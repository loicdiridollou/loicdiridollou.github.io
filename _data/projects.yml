    Using a dataset from AirBnb Open Data, I conducted performance comparisons to predict the prices of stay. The best performance was achieved 
    with a five Dense-layer network with regularisation and dropout with an accuracy of 70% while the XGBoost only achieved 68%.

    Using Santander customer data, the goal of this project was to explore different classification methods to predict a certain type of banking transactions.
    The best model was a combination of using XGBoost model and StratifiedKFold cross validation.

    I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
