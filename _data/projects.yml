    Comparing different methods to predict AirBnB prices in New York City, regression, random forest, XGBoost, neural networks
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Using a dataset from AirBnb Open Data, I conducted performance comparisons to predict the prices of stay. 
    The best performance was achieved with a five Dense-layer network with regularisation and dropout with an 
    accuracy of 70% while the XGBoost only achieved 68%.

    Clustering customer data to identify and profile a certain type of customer that will conduct a precise banking operation
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Using Santander customer data, the goal of this project was to explore different classification methods to predict a 
    certain type of banking transactions. The best model was a combination of using XGBoost model and StratifiedKFold cross 
    validation.

    Transfer learning applied to bird recognition
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The idea of this project was to explore the difference between the model that I would build on my own and a model that 
    has already been trained. In the field of computer vision, the model needs a lot of data and training to perform well 
    so without surprise the pretrained model (ImageNet18) surpassed the locally built model.

    Computational analysis of different option pricing methodologies based on Monte Carlo simulation (academic project)
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    This project explored different variations of Monte Carlo simulations. The different analysis revealed that a Quasi 
    Random Monte Carlo Simulation was the one that performed the best among the different ones (antithetic variables, Quasi 
    MC, Random MC, ...). This project was conducted with the Black-Scholes European Call closed form as a benchmark and two 
    metrics were tracked for performance assessment: speed of convergence and variance of results.

    First overview of computer vision and facial recognition mixed with my favorite TV series Suits
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    I started this project to introduce myself to computer vision. I am also a fan of Suits and I thought joining the two ends
    could be a great way to move forward with this project. I thus designed a face recognitiion using YOLO algorithm and open-
    cv. The idea was to identify the face in the image (treating the TV series as a sequence of images) and later identifying
    the faces of the character. It achieved a really good performance in recognizing faces with a 97% accuracy.
