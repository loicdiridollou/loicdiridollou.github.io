  Prior to the MFE, Loic studied statistics and economics at ENSAE Paris where he developed solid skills in stochastic calculus, probability, econometrics, and machine learning using different languages (Python, R and C++). He also holds an associate degree in law from Paris I Panth√©on-Sorbonne University.
  His internship experience includes asset management, equity trading and quantitative research. While at the Dutch investment bank Kempen, he worked on several data science and machine learning projects to help traders identify signals. Then, in a quantitative research role at EY Advisory, he was responsible for developing and calibrating a local volatility model that improved option pricing precision as well as working on call-spread options P&L calculations and client engagements for major French banks.
  Loic enjoys exploring innovative methodologies with machine learning such as evolution strategies for trading and deep learning for options pricing. He also has a keen interest in systematic trading and quantitative strategies. Loic spends his free time reading economic news and studying geopolitics; he is also a longtime sailor and sailing instructor.
